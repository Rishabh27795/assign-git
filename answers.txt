1) What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?

to ignore before making a commit. The gitignore should include the 
followin files for a java project.
- Compiled class file
- Log file
- BlueJ files
- Package Files
- Virtual machine crash logs, etc.


2) What does fast-forward in Git mean?
A) When your checked-out branch is behind the branch that you're trying 
to merge with, GIT performs a fast forward. When you try to merge these 
branches, GIT fast forwards the master branch's pointer to match the 
merged commits in order to avoid conflicts.


3) Why should you have different branches?
A) You should laways have one master branch where the code is stable and 
merged. If everyone works on the master branch, there is a high 
possibility of messing up the master branch. Intead, working on 
different branches and then merging it with master helps avoid conflicts 
and keeps the code safe. For example you are working on a car project. 
One person creates a branch called "wheels" and another person creates a 
branch called "seats". They can individually work on their branches and 
then merge thier work to the master branch of the car. This helps in 
parallel working as well.

4) In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
A) You usually have only one remote git repository in a project.
